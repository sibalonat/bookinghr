## Booking HR

This is an snipet code dedicated to booking an appointment. It can work very well with any type of implementation. I will continue reviewing if it needs additional refactoring.

# Addition
[ 
    * - Framework: Laravel
    * - Livewire public attributes and properties
    * - There is no js
    [
        ## Additional ++
        The structure of the code is as follows, there is a Booking directory where is the filters for segmented availability and services to book for additional times. 
        
        in the http folder then there is a folder for livewire controller(alias)
        and then in the resources there is a similar folder for livewire work
